# FireFightingBot-
The "Autonomous Firefighting System" project uses cutting-edge robotics to pioneer a
revolutionary approach to fire safety. The system, which consists of an Arduino Uno, a
Flame sensor, and specialized motors, can detect and put out fires on its own and react
quickly in a variety of settings. This initiative, which draws inspiration from worldwide fire crises and makes use of automation, not only introduces an innovative technology but
also addresses the urgent need for improved firefighting capabilities in areas such as
Nepal. It provides hope for a reduction in fire-related fatalities and the protection of lives and property.
